# Task: 
# Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:
# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

# Input Format: 
# The first line contains the first integer, a. The second line contains the second integer, b.

# Output Format: 
# Print the three lines as explained above.

# Sample Input: 
# 3
# 2

# Sample Output: 
# 5
# 1
# 6

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT.
a = int(raw_input())
b = int(raw_input())

print a + b
print a - b
print a * b
