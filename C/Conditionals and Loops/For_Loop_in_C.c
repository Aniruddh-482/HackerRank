/*
For Loop in C

Objective: 
In this challenge, you will learn the usage of the for loop, 
which is a programming language statement which allows code to be executed until a terminal condition is met. 
They can even repeat forever if the terminal condition is never met.

The syntax for the for loop is:

    for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
        <statement>

  * expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop.
  * expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
  * expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.

The following loop initializes i to 0, tests that i is less than 10, and increments i at every iteration. It will execute 10 times.

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        ...
    }

Task: 
For each integer n in the interval [a, b] (given as input) :
  * If 1 <= n <= 9, then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for 1, "two" for 2, and so on.
  * Else if n > 9 and it is an even number, then print "even".
  * Else if n > 9 and it is an odd number, then print "odd".

Input Format: 
The first line contains an integer, a.
The seond line contains an integer, b.

Constraints: 
1 <= a <= b <= 10^6

Output Format: 
Print the appropriate English representation,even, or odd, based on the conditions described in the 'task' section.

Sample Input: 
  8
  11

Sample Output: 
  eight
  nine
  even
  odd
